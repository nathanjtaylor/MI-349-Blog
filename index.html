        <h3>A Brief History</h3>

        <p>The exact origin of Orcs is widely spectulated, but in reality is unknown. Some believe Orcs were created during the First Age when Melkor tortured and twisted captured Elves into unrecognizable forms, others speculate Orcs are the reincarnation of evil souls, something of a punishment for their past misdeeds. However, one thing is known for certain, Orcs were bred for war to participate as foot soldiers in dark armies, often large swaths of their entire population would be forced to participate in battles, which would result in near extinction after their typical defeat. Many will tell you that Orcs live for evil, have no capacity for empathy, and don't know anything but battle, and for the average Orc who has lived throughout history, this may have been a good summation of their life. However one must wonder, over the span of multiple millenia, surely a different story can be told, there has to be examples of Orcs who haven't lived this life, or those that have tried to escape it.</p>

        <p>It was in the Second Age that we saw the first documented Orkish dissenters. After the Dark Lord reappeared in Middle-earth to claim Mordor, many Orkish tribes flocked to his banner, however there were some distant Orcs to the east who resisted his call. Many historians would tell you that these Orcs despised the fair form of Sauron upon his original return, and after he shed his skin and showing his true vile form they followed suit, but I don't agree with this theory. Some of those eastern tribes, mainly the Green Foot were mysteriously exiled from their western homes years prior, and based on the documented behavior of these groups some speculate their exile was because these Orcs has lost their ruthless spirit. I propose it was instead the direct magical influence of Sauron that pulled these Orcs back under his fold, for after his defeats in his wars against the Elves, he was looking for numbers en masse and quick.</p>

        <p>One thing about Dwarves that everyone knows is their incredible knack for making things, this no one challenges. Dwarvish architecture is one of the most beautiful things I have ever seen, but have you ever wondered where Orcs get their armaments? Well they make it themselves. Weapons and armor produced on that scale is no small undertaking, it can take months for Humans or Elves to suit an army with a fresh set of arms, but for Orcs, it can take weeks to days. You won't find an Orc who prides themselves on the design of their creation, but you will find ones that are proud of the speed and effectiveness of the things they make. To further this point few will tell you about the various military developments that came from studying the vary armor and weapons that Orcs wear. Many Dwarves would like to remain the unquestioned rulers of craft and mining that they are seen as, but I have found a shocking amount of quiet animosity from Dwarves towards Orcs not because of the century-long history of war, but because of their apparently terrible craftsmanship. Maybe they know something.</p>

        <h3>The Psychology of Orcs</h3>

        <p>In the far reaches of Mordor I discovered a small community of Orcs in hiding and attempted to live among them to learn their ways. After the destruction of the One Ring, the united forces of Orckind were disbanded, large swaths of surviving Orcs formed groups, many of whom would go on to continue the war in some fashion. Now after sixty years much of Orckind has exterminated, and only small Orkish communities remainin hiding. This group which called themselves the Dorr, originally reacted to me and my troops presence with hostility, however upon the offer of supplies and trade, they were willing to tolerate us. We made it clear we would hide our things, to dissuade them from attacking or stealing from us in the night. Their village was built in two, structures above and below ground, this group in particular was apart of a warband that broke ranks and retrated, according to the Orcs here their name would forever be tarnished. Which leads me to an interesting discovery that would define my findings here, self-hatred.</p>

        <p>Over time, the Orcs were able to accept my presence, our communication ability grew as I improved my Black Speech, some members of their community were interested in my tounge as the two languages bear some similarity. In honestly I am uncertain what I expected going into this, but the Orkish community was shockingly unremarkable, it was certainly different, but they gathered food and water, built structures, engaged socially. The Orcs did have something of a blood sport, but I never saw any fatalities, they tols me they were trying to conserve their small numbers. Interestingly the Orcs were vocally hostile towards their supposed creator &ndash; Melkor, they often spoke bad about him for creating them. See this was the crux of my theory which I developed, all of Orkish culture, loving disgusting things, craving battle and violence, I believe it all stems from an immense self-hatred that is behind each and every Orc.</p>

        <p>There were only a small number of times during my time among the Dorr that I was able to get myself alone in a room with just one Orc, but these times were the most revealing, there was one Orc named Gustonk who I was able to meet with a total of twelve times throughout my time among them. Gustonk was clearly interested in me and what I had to say, where most other Orcs didn't even take in my words of self-care, I could tell Gustonk wanted something more. In our meetings I encouraged him to explore things in his day-to-day life that made him feel good, and to challange his expectations about what he should or could be. Over our meetings I kept track about the way he spoke of things, counting the number of positive and negative experiences we talked about.</p>
