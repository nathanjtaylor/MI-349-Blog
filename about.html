                I am Lumormben Kithril, a scholar of the mind, a science that I find is often disrespected when compared to other studies. I studied psychology at Rithion University and have been attempting to bolster my field's recognition for over 100 years now. Currently, I manage of chain of colleagues who venture the realms promoting awareness of mental health for all people. I am the architect of the Similar Mind Theorem, despite the various biological differences between the races of the realms, our minds work in far more similar ways, and despite what propaganda Elendil's Council might spit, the immortal mind is not superior and is infact trife with mortal issues.

            <h2>Travels</h2>
            <p>
                In my persuit of knowledge and recognition I have found myself in some rather interesting situations which I wish to share here:
                <ol>
                    <li>After the destruction of the Dark Lord the world was rapidly changing and I sought to take advantage of this. I travelled to Rohan where I befriended King Éomer, for 22 years I sat on his council, where we oversaw much of the local reconstruction and some foreign peace establishment</li>
                    <li>After the king's health began to wither, I was removed from the council. I travelled back home to Lothlórien, I enjoyed the respite and nostalgia, but things were as stagnant as ever</li>
                    <li>I had heard of the building propsperity of Erebor, the new major kingdom of Dwarves, having never been to Moria before its fall I must say, Iwas impressed with the attention to detail. It was while living in Erebor that I formated by Similar Mind Theorem</li>
                    <li>I was quietly exiled from Erebor after growing perhaps a bit too radical, an approach I have since abandoned. I then travelled to the Shire, a stunning place. This is where I found my first likeminded scholar &ndash; Opal Oldbuck. She was the one that inspired me to spread this movement to other parts of Arda. The Hobbits of Hobbiton already have the idea of mental well-being baked into their culture, and such convincing many that such things could be studied was easier than expected there</li>
                    <li>I decided to take on my first real challenge after by experience with the Hobbits, I wanted to study Orcs. Everyone told me it was a stupid idea, but I could think of no better way to prove my theory than to push it to its limits. I hired a band of experienced mercenaries to accompony me to Mordor, where we found and lived with a small community of Orcs for 2 years</li>
